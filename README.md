# Digi-XBee3-802.15.4-TH-modules-Cyclical-Communication-c
The code provides handling of wireless communication between two XBee devices. One device function as the sender and the other as the receiver. The primary objective of the script is to evaluate the characteristics of this communication by transmitting a predetermined number of frames between the sender and receiver. The code measures the round-trip time (RTT) for each frame, which is the amount of time it takes for a frame to travel from the sender to the receiver and back again. It accomplishes this by documenting the start time before transmitting the frame and the end time shaft receiving the response. The RTT is the difference between the two timestamps.
In addition, the code verifies that the received frame matches the original sent frame. If they match the frame is considered effectively received. If the received frame differs from the sent frame, the frame is considered lost. In such circumstances, the code maintains notes of the lost frame content and writes the information to a CSV file for further analysis.
The code calculates the total time required for all frames, the number of received frames, and the number of missing frames throughout the procedure. After concluding the frame transmission and receiving cycle, it divides the total time by the number of frames to determine the average round-trip time. The packet delivery ratio is also computed by dividing the number of received frames by the total number of frames. The code provides informative output by printing the average latency, total time, packet delivery ratio, and if any, the number of lost frames. This information aids in evaluating the efficacy and dependability of the XBee module-based communication between the two devices.
